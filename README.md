# NCAA_Data
Data for the paper entitled "Energy-efficient distributed heterogeneous blocking flowshop scheduling problem using a knowledge-based iterated Pareto greedy algorithm"
# Instances
Instance benchmark. There are 600 instances that are grouped by the number of factories. Each subfolder contains 150 instances that have the same number of factories, and each instance is recorded in a file.
# ComponentsResults
Experimental results for analyzing the effects of components. Each file records the calculation results of one algorithm for one instance.
# ComparisonResults
Experimental results for comparing KBIPG with other algorithms. Each file records the calculation results of one algorithm for one instance.
# AnalysisResults
Data processed by IBM SPSS Statistics 22.
